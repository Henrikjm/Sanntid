Atomic operations:

"An operation during which a processor can simultaneously read a location and write it in the same bus operation. This prevents any other processor or I/O device from writing or reading memory until the operation is complete.
Atomic implies indivisibility and irreducibility, so an atomic operation must be performed entirely or not performed at all."

"An atomic operation is an operation that will always be executed without any other process being able to read or change state that is read or changed during the operation. It is effectively executed as a single step, and is an important quality in a number of algorithms that deal with multiple indepent processes, both in synchronization and algorithms that update shared data without requiring synchronization."

Semaphore:
A semaphore is a variable or abstract data type that is used for controlling access

Mutex:
Mutual exclusion refers to the requirement of ensuring that no two processes or threads (henceforth referred to only as processes) are in their critical section at the same time. Here, a critical section refers to a period of time when the process accesses a shared resource, such as shared memory.
